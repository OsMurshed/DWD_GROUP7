On the ground floor there werecommunal washing areas, with washing machines and driers and therewas always someone to chat to. Neighbours across the landing, and inthe maisonettes, were always ready and willing to help out - be it lookingafter children or doing shopping. Shopping in those days was close by asthe local shops in Oxgangs provided most things. There was a newsagent,butcher, greengrocer, dairy, fish shop, hairdresser and even a hardwareshop. These shops provided another great meeting place where customersand shop assistants were on first name terms.Life in Capelaw, Allermuir and Caerketton Court was like living in a largecommunity rolled into one. Adults and children alike made friends andthere were regular coffee days, birthday and other special parties. As the children grew up together they went on to nursery and then to school.In the summer, the park was a great place where the kids ran freely and the adults relaxed.

Lifelong friendships were formed by both children andadults.My first vivid memory of life in the flats was standing up on tip toes inbare feet on the warm underfloor heated tiles, looking out the window atthe snow dancing in the HUGE park and listening to the wind whistling,and feeling so safe and secure. Maybe that?s why the high rise flats stillevoke that feeling of safety, even allowing for the fact that the lovelywarm floor kept cracking and cost a fortune to use. It was made of thenew wonder material asbestos!Summers were spent in that same park learning everything from tennisto rounders, skipping and elastics. The ?Tunnels?

Its rural roots are taken from the name: Oxgangs derives fromthe area of a farm that could be ploughed by a single ox. The originalfarmstead in Oxgangs was built on the land which is now occupied by thePolice Station. It lay on a drover?s path from the Pentlands, and was also awalking ground for the gentry, linked by paths to the Hermitage of Braid.The first sign of residential housing in Oxgangs was the self-builds forpost office workers and the pre-war prefabs.All this lies in contrast to the ultra modern high rise flats planned bythe City Council in the mid 1950s. The ?Village in the Sky? at Oxgangswas full of innovative technology and architecture ? all electric flatswith underfloor heating, inside toilets, communal laundry facilities at thebottom of stairs, private balconies with spectacular views over the Forth,the city skyline and the Pentland Hills.

Others wounded 6 O.R.?At least now I had part of the answer.  There is no mention of burial or other information relating to this incident.
