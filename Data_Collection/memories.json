The actor Sean Connery served as a Portobello lifeguard in the post war period. The pool was closed in 1979, not long after the power station, and the area is now used for five-a-side football.",

   "Year": "1996",
   "About": "'Teletubbies' was the first television programme deliberately aimed at children as young as one year old. Produced for the BBC by Rag doll Productions in 1996, it was the brainchild of Anne Wood and Andrew Davenport. The programme used bright colours, repetition and 'emergent' language which sparked a huge debate about its educational value, as well as the pros and cons of television for very young children. In spite of the controversy, the Teletubbies have proved extremely popular, both on television and off the screen in the form of dolls, toys and books. Characters Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po were the stars of the show.'Teletubbies say eh-oh!'",

One Sunday afternoon in the mid 60s when the tide was far out,  I found 6/- (72 pennies) on the beach at the Hawes Pier.  An absolute fortune for a 6 year old!   Some of the pennies were very discoloured so we used to soak them in jars of vinegar to remove the algae and green copper corrosion.  When cleaned up, most of the pennies were spent in our local sweet shop on our way home from school.There must be a treasure trove of old pennies on the seabed under the Rail Bridge.",

It was thought that we would be isolated and lonely, butnothing could be further from the truth. On the ground floor there werecommunal washing areas, with washing machines and driers and therewas always someone to chat to. Neighbours across the landing, and inthe maisonettes, were always ready and willing to help out - be it lookingafter children or doing shopping. Shopping in those days was close by asthe local shops in Oxgangs provided most things. There was a newsagent,butcher, greengrocer, dairy, fish shop, hairdresser and even a hardwareshop. These shops provided another great meeting place where customersand shop assistants were on first name terms.Life in Capelaw, Allermuir and Caerketton Court was like living in a largecommunity rolled into one. Adults and children alike made friends andthere were regular coffee days, birthday and other special parties. As the children grew up together they went on to nursery and then to school.In the summer, the park was a great place where the kids ran freely and the adults relaxed. We had some great times and lots of fun in the flats and weknow we will never have another house with a view like the one from 12/1 Capelaw court.",

I grew up calling our next door neighbours Aunty Mo and UncleEddie. Lifelong friendships were formed by both children andadults.My first vivid memory of life in the flats was standing up on tip toes inbare feet on the warm underfloor heated tiles, looking out the window atthe snow dancing in the HUGE park and listening to the wind whistling,and feeling so safe and secure. Maybe that�s why the high rise flats stillevoke that feeling of safety, even allowing for the fact that the lovelywarm floor kept cracking and cost a fortune to use. It was made of thenew wonder material asbestos!Summers were spent in that same park learning everything from tennisto rounders, skipping and elastics. The �Tunnels� (which were water pipesleft over from the building work) beside the drying area was your ganghut. We were easily amused, and you had nothing but the limits of yourimagination to keep you back.",

But sadly in July last year Bockarie tragically lost his life whilst swimming in Bonaly reservoir with his friends. It was such a big loss to Firrhill and it was hard knowing we wouldnt see him again. Every year around the time of his death, there is going to be a memorial to remember Bockarie for what a good, loving, caring person he was. He is missed so much by everyone and will never be forgotten.",

We had to wait about half an hour in a huge line to buy a wristband and get into the fair and i got annoyed while standing in the line, I got annoyed because Charlotte said to Abbie that she would go on all the rides with her and I told them I felt third wheeled and they said they would go on some of the rides with me. Luckily the rides we wanted to go on were 3 seaters so that meant no one was left out. My favourite ride was the crazy frog because it had 3 seats and it was shaped like a kind of frog and you would sit in it. It would go superfast and bounce everywhere while in the air and I could not stop laughing. I could not stop laughing because Abbie wouldn't stop screaming because me and Charlotte were squashing into Abbie and I found it hard to breathe because I was laughing that much. I also saw Jade there.",

Everyone was so exited that they were actually going to see One Direction, the biggest boy band in the world. There was a massive line for merchandise and drinks. When we went in it wasn�t very organised but everyone was focused on getting to their seats. 5 Seconds of Summer were their support act and they were incredible. Then One Direction came on and everyone went mental, there was so much screaming and some girls were crying when they started singing. Once they had finished everyone cheered. Walking out of the stadium everyone was singing One Direction songs and it was so exiting and I started to sing along.",

She rallied parents together and asked for support financially. Although it would not be a lot, it was a lot to some folks and it caused some controversy. A school badge was specially designed.  Miss Edmund was strict and eventually was held in high regard by both parents and children.  She taught us all to be proud of our school. School outings were sometimes to Edinburgh Zoo and Gullane in East Lothian. The summers always seemed to be warm.",

Its rural roots are taken from the name: Oxgangs derives fromthe area of a farm that could be ploughed by a single ox. The originalfarmstead in Oxgangs was built on the land which is now occupied by thePolice Station. It lay on a drover�s path from the Pentlands, and was also awalking ground for the gentry, linked by paths to the Hermitage of Braid.The first sign of residential housing in Oxgangs was the self-builds forpost office workers and the pre-war prefabs.All this lies in contrast to the ultra modern high rise flats planned bythe City Council in the mid 1950s. The �Village in the Sky� at Oxgangswas full of innovative technology and architecture � all electric flatswith underfloor heating, inside toilets, communal laundry facilities at thebottom of stairs, private balconies with spectacular views over the Forth,the city skyline and the Pentland Hills. This was no run down estate buta flagship project designed to lure skilled workers to the city from ruralareas, or rehousing workers from other areas that were being developed.Most of the new residents were young, aspiring, working families, able toafford the high rents.",

Later in June, the Royal Family came to Holyrood Palace. I recall my father walking me there. A huge celebration took place with massed bands in the grounds.Thousands turned out and the atmosphere was amazing.We were all handed a 'Song Sheet' with the words of all the old wartime songs. Eventually the Queen appeared on the balcony wearing her Coronation gown. I was 8 years old then.My father lifted me up on his shoulders and even in the distance I could see all her diamonds sparkling.It was a magical night.",

The gas mantles were lit with long wax tapers. The delicate mantels had to be replaced regularly. They were constructed from a fine white mesh, the size of a golf ball. As soon as they were lit,  the Daddy Longlegs appeared making the scene even more eerie. The light 'hissed' and I hated having to use it,my mother having to accompany me shivering with cold in the winter.",

Some 60 competitors took part.From this event and others which followed the Edinburgh Triathlon Club was formed and this has gone on to be the largest and most successful tri-club in Scotland with members competing internationally and in all types of events from short distance to Ironman competitions and ultras.  The club  Edinburgh Triathletes celebrates its 25th birthday this year (2015).Throughout the country other events were established and clubs formed.  Members of these came together at WHEC and formed the Scottish Triathlon Association - now called Triathlon Scotland. From these early beginnings Triathlon Scotland has promoted the sport and devised coaching courses and awards.  Like the sport itself the Edinburgh Club and Triathlon Scotland have gone from strength to strength.",

In essence it states John and the others had just finished their lunch on that fateful day and were sitting around chatting when a German shell exploded at the door of the billet killing the eleven men.  They were buried that afternoon in the local cemetery.  The three who died of wounds were treated, I assume, at a field hospital and are buried in Mericourt Cemetery a short distance away.As I note at the start Perseverance pays and in this case I am finally satisfied about the outcome.However if anyone can provide information on Archie Dick I would be most grateful to receive this.

They served in various sectors in the European conflict and both received severe wounds at Ypres resulting on them being invalided home to Canada.",

However after several months a contact on the web said he was visiting the National Records at Kew and would see what he could uncover.  To my delight he found the war diary of the 97th Coy. Royal Engineers and had it copied to CD.  An entry on that fateful day � 26 June 1916 � stated:-�Shell (13 mm) burst in billet.  Killed 11.  Died of wounds 3. Others wounded 6 O.R.�At least now I had part of the answer.  There is no mention of burial or other information relating to this incident.  For years I wondered if the shell was one the company were working on to be used in the bombardment prior to the Somme offensive, or whether it  was a German shell that killed these men.  For several years I have pondered over this and tried to find the answer.",

In both instances I was successful.  The head Librarian at the time told me the Roll of Honour of Leith Casualties which had been produced following the war was in the care of Lothian Health Services Archive and the local newspaper of the time the �Leith Observer� carried many obituaries.  Searching through these I found John�s obituary but also on reading it further revelations appeared.  Not only he but five of his brothers had served in the forces during the conflict. All had volunteered at the start of the war.",

We played on it, trying to smash the ice. We even dared to walk under the bridges which got us rebukes from passers-by! I suppose when your only ten, risks like that are just fun.How often does the canal freeze over fully? Once or twice in a life time? Maybe again this winter.P.S.

So, his little monument was one of the first things I wanted to see in Edinburgh, partly also to re-enforce my convictions that stories about animals such as dogs will always find a good readership.  Bobby's story has encouraged me to complete my series of children's books in which a dog is the protagonist along with his many furry and feathered friends.",
